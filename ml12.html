                                <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
								<p>
                                    The problem at hand is to predict an individual's salary based on various socio-demographic factors, specifically focusing on the variables of country and race. This is a regression problem where the goal is to build a model that can estimate an individual's income based on their demographic attributes.</br>
                                       <b> The project objectives outline the specific goals to be achieved, which might include::</b></br>
                                      <b> Salary Prediction:</b> Develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate an individual's salary based on their age, gender, education, country, race, and years of experience.</br>
                                        <b>Demographic Analysis: </b>Explore and analyze the dataset to understand the relationships and patterns between income and various demographic factors, particularly focusing on the influence of country and race.</br>
                                            <b>Feature Importance: </b>Identify which demographic attributes have the most significant impact on salary predictions.</br>
                                                <b>Data Preprocessing:</b> Prepare the dataset for modeling by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling or normalizing features as needed.</br>
                                                    <b>Model Selection and Training:</b> Choose appropriate regression algorithms, train the models, and optimize their hyperparameters.</br>
                                                        <b>Evaluation: </b>Assess the model's performance using relevant regression metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE) or root mean squared error (RMSE).</br>
                                                            <b>Interpretability:</b> Understand how each demographic factor contributes to salary predictions, which can provide insights into income disparities and variations.</br>
                                                                <b> Inequality Analysis: </b>Investigate and visualize potential income disparities or variations across different countries and racial groups.</br>
                                                                
                                    </p>
                                    <h2>About the dataset</h2>
								<p>
                                    <b>The dataset used in this project is a comprehensive collection of salary and demographic information with additional details on years of experience. It includes the following demographic attributes:</b></br>

                                    Age: Age of the individual.</br>
                                    Gender: Gender of the individual.</br>
                                    Education: Education level of the individual.</br>
                                    Country: The country where the individual resides.</br>
                                    Race: The racial background of the individual.</br>
                                    Years of Experience: The number of years of professional experience.</br>
                                    Salary: The target variable indicating the individual's salary.</br>
                                    The dataset provides a diverse range of variables for analysis, allowing researchers to study income distribution across different demographic categories. It also considers the impact of years of experience on salary, adding a dynamic dimension to the analysis.

                                </p>
                                
                                
                                                                                    <h2>Expected Outcomes</h2>
                                                                                    <p>
                                                                                        The expected outcome of this project is a predictive model that can estimate an individual's salary based on their demographic attributes, with a specific focus on the influence of country and race. Additionally, the project aims to provide insights into the factors that contribute to income disparities or variations across different demographic groups. This may involve identifying the most influential factors, visualizing income patterns, and analyzing potential inequalities in earning potential.
