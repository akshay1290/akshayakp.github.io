                                <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
								<p>
                                    The problem at hand is to predict the presence or absence of sleep disorders based on a comprehensive set of variables related to sleep patterns, daily habits, and health metrics. This is a binary classification problem where the goal is to build a model that can accurately identify individuals who are likely to have sleep disorders based on their characteristics and habits.</br>
                                       <b> The project objectives outline the specific goals to be achieved, which might include::</b></br>
                                      <b>1. Sleep Disorder Prediction:</b> Develop a predictive model that can classify individuals into two categories: those with sleep disorders and those without sleep disorders.</br>
                                        <b>2. Feature Analysis: </b>Explore the dataset to identify which variables are most relevant for predicting the presence of sleep disorders.</br>
                                            <b>3.Data Preprocessing: </b>Prepare the dataset for modeling by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling or normalizing features as needed.</br>
                                                <b>4.Model Selection and Training:</b> Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for classification, train the models, and optimize their hyperparameters.</br>
                                                    <b>4.Evaluation:</b> Assess the model's performance using relevant classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.</br>
                                                        <b>5.Interpretability: </b>Understand which features and habits are most influential in predicting sleep disorders, which can provide insights into potential risk factors.</br>
                                                            <b>6.Recommendations:</b> Provide recommendations for individuals who are at a higher risk of sleep disorders based on the model's predictions and feature importance..</br>

                                    <h2>About the dataset</h2>
								<p>
                                    <b>The "Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset" used in this project comprises 400 rows and 13 columns, covering a wide range of variables related to sleep, daily habits, and health metrics. These variables include:</b></br>

                                    Gender: Gender of the individual.</br>
                                    Age: Age of the individual.</br>
                                    Occupation: Occupation of the individual.</br>
                                    Sleep Duration: The amount of time an individual spends sleeping.</br>
                                    Quality of Sleep: A measure of the quality of an individual's sleep.</br>

                                    BMI Category: The body mass index (BMI) category of the individual.</br>
                                    Blood Pressure: Blood pressure measurements.</br>
                                    Heart Rate: Heart rate measurements.</br>
                                    Daily Steps: The number of steps taken by the individual.</br>

                                                                                    <p>

Additionally, the project aims to provide insights into the factors and habits that are most influential in predicting the presence of sleep disorders. This may involve identifying risk factors, understanding the impact of lifestyle choices, and offering recommendations for individuals who may be at higher risk based on the model's predictions.
