## Data Science Projects
-------------------------------------
### Machine Learning Projects 
1. [PREDICTING CUSTOMER CHURN IN A TELECOM COMPANY](https://github.com/akshay1290/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/churn_prediction-main/churn_prediction-main)
   - **Description:** customer churn prediction project in a telecom company is a reduction in churn rates and an increase in customer retention. This leads to financial benefits, improved customer satisfaction, and a competitive edge in the industry. Additionally, the project establishes data-driven decision-making processes for ongoing improvement.
   - **Technologies Used:** The notebooks uses Decision Tree Classification, Random forest classifier, XGBoost classifier and oversampling (SMOTE)
   - **Results:** The after oversampling Random forest classifier gives 93% F1 score.
2. [IMPACT OF MEDICATION FOR LIFESTYLE DISEASES ON HOSPITAL READMISSION](https://github.com/akshay1290/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/patient-readmission-main)
   -  **Description:** Lifestyle diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, and obesity, pose a significant healthcare challenge, leading to high hospital readmission rates. These chronic conditions not only affect the quality of life for patients but also impose a substantial economic burden on healthcare systems. To address this issue, we aim to investigate the impact of medication management on hospital readmission rates for patients with lifestyle diseas
   - **Technologies Used:** The notebooks uses Decision Tree classifier and Random forest classifier
   - **Results:** The Random forest classifier  model performs the best with accuracy of 76%
3. [MALL CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION](https://github.com/akshay1290/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/mall_customer_segmenation-main/mall_customer_segmenation-main)
   -  **Description:** Customer Segmentation is a popular application of unsupervised learning. Using clustering, identify segments of customers to target the potential user base. They divide customers into groups according to common characteristics like gender, age, interests, and spending habits so they can market to each group effectively. Use K-means clustering and also visualize the gender and age distributions. Then analyze their annual incomes and spending scores.
   - **Technologies Used:** The notebooks uses K-means clustering Algorithm
   - **Results:** Apply the K-means clustering algorithm to group customers into segments based on their annual incomes and spending scores. Experiment with different numbers of clusters (K) to find the optimal segmentation.

4. [MOVIE AWARD PREDICTION](https://github.com/akshay1290/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/movie_award-prediction-main/movie_award-prediction-main)
   -  **Description:** The problem is to develop a predictive model that can predict whether a movie is likely to win an award or receive critical acclaim based on various features related to the movie's production, marketing, cast, and other factors. This predictive model aims to assist the film industry in making strategic decisions about resource allocation and marketing strategies for upcoming movies. 
   - **Technologies Used:** The notebooks uses logistic regression, support vector machine.
   - **Results:** The Support vector Machine performs the best with 60% accuracy

5. [NO-CODE AI PROJECT FOR DECISION TREE REGRESSION APP](https://github.com/akshay1290/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/streamlit_app7-main/streamlit_app7-main)
    -  **Description:**  The "No-Code AI Project for Decision Tree Regression App" aims to create a user-friendly application that empowers non-technical users to perform predictive modeling using Decision Tree Regression. The project involves application development, algorithm integration, data processing, and visualization to provide users with an accessible tool for regression analysis. The ultimate goal is to make AI accessible to a wider audience and improve predictive capabilities for users without extensive data science knowledge.
    - **Technologies Used:** The notebooks uses Descision Tree regression, Python, Streamlit, CI/CD, Docker and Microsoft Azure Cloud (App services)
    - **Results:** A functional and user-friendly application that enables non-technical users to perform Decision Tree Regression for predictive modeling.

### Deep Learning Projects 

1. [HOUSE PRICE PREDICTION USING PYTORCH](https://github.com/akshay1290/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/Deep-Leaning-poject-using-pytorch-main/Deep-Leaning-poject-using-pytorch-main)
    -  **Description:** This project aims to develop a deep learning-based solution for house price prediction using PyTorch. It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model development, evaluation, and potentially deployment. The dataset contains various features related to residential properties, and the target variable is the sale price of the houses. The ultimate goal is to create a reliable model that can assist individuals in estimating the market value of houses, which can be valuable for both buyers and sellers in the real estate market.
    - **Technologies Used:** The notebooks uses Deep learning and PyTorch
    - **Results:** Build a deep learning regression model using PyTorch to learn the complex relationships between the input features and the target variable.
