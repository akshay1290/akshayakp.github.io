                                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
								<p>
                                    The "Impact of Medication for Lifestyle Diseases on Hospital Readmission" project is a comprehensive study designed to understand the role of medication adherence and management in reducing hospital readmissions among patients with lifestyle-related health conditions. Leveraging data analytics and healthcare insights, this project seeks to identify patterns, factors, and best practices associated with medication use and its influence on patient outcomes..</p>
                                    <h2>About the dataset</h2>
								<p>
                                    The dataset used for this project consists of patient records and related healthcare data, including but not limited to:</br>

                                    Patient demographics (age, gender, ethnicity)</br>
                                    Lifestyle disease diagnosis (e.g., diabetes, hypertension)</br>
                                    Medication prescription details (type, dosage, frequency)</br>
                                    Hospital admission and discharge dates</br>
                                    Clinical measurements (e.g., blood pressure, blood glucose levels)</br>
                                    Previous hospitalizations and readmission history</br>
                                    Healthcare provider information</br>
                                    This dataset spans a defined timeframe and includes a diverse sample of patients with lifestyle diseases across multiple healthcare facilities.
                                </p>
