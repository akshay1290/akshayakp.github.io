									<h2><a href="#">Machine Learning</a></h2>
									<p>Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computer systems to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data, without being explicitly programmed for each specific task. In essence, machine learning allows computers to improve their performance on a task as they are exposed to more data.</p>

									<p> " The TMDB-5000 dataset is a rich source of movie-related data, including information about over 5,000 movies, user ratings, and metadata. The recommendation system aims to leverage this dataset by implementing an average weighted recommendation algorithm that considers various factors to suggest movies that closely match a user's preferences. These factors may include user ratings, genres, popularity, and similarity to previously liked movies. "</p>
