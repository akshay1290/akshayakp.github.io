								<div class="image main"><img src="images/ccp.jpg" alt="" /></div>
                                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
								<p>
                                    The "Predicting Customer Churn in a Telecom Company" project is aimed at leveraging data analytics and machine learning techniques to address the critical issue of customer churn within our telecom organization. Churn refers to the phenomenon where customers discontinue their subscriptions or services, resulting in revenue loss and reduced customer base. By proactively identifying potential churners and implementing targeted retention strategies, this project aims to improve customer retention rates, enhance customer satisfaction, and maintain a competitive edge in the telecommunications market.</p>
                                    <h2>About the dataset</h2>
								<p>
                                    The dataset you've provided appears to be a tabular dataset with 7043 rows and 21 columns. Each row represents a customer, and each column represents a different attribute or feature related to those customers. This dataset is used for predicting customer churn in a telecom company.</br>

<b>1.customerID:</b> A unique identifier for each customer. This column is of type "object."</br>

<b>2.gender: </b>The gender of the customer (e.g., male or female). This column is of type "object."</br>

<b>3.SeniorCitizen:</b> An indicator of whether the customer is a senior citizen (1 for yes, 0 for no). This column is of type "int64."</br>

<b>4.Partner: </b>An indicator of whether the customer has a partner (e.g., "Yes" or "No"). This column is of type "object."</br>

<b>5.Dependents:</b> An indicator of whether the customer has dependents (e.g., "Yes" or "No"). This column is of type "object."</br>

<b>6.tenure: </b>The number of months the customer has been with the telecom company. This column is of type "int64."</br>

<b>7.PhoneService:</b> An indicator of whether the customer has phone service (e.g., "Yes" or "No"). This column is of type "object."</br>

<b>8.MultipleLines:</b> An indicator of whether the customer has multiple phone lines (e.g., "Yes," "No," or "No phone service"). This column is of type "object."</br>

<b>9.InternetService:</b> The type of internet service subscribed by the customer (e.g., DSL, Fiber optic, No internet service). This column is of type "object."</br>

<b>10.OnlineSecurity: </b>An indicator of whether the customer has online security (e.g., "Yes," "No," or "No internet service"). This column is of type "object."</br>

<b>11.OnlineBackup:</b> An indicator of whether the customer has online backup (e.g., "Yes," "No," or "No internet service"). This column is of type "object."</br>

<b>12.DeviceProtection:</b> An indicator of whether the customer has device protection (e.g., "Yes," "No," or "No internet service"). This column is of type "object."</br>

<b>13.TechSupport: </b>An indicator of whether the customer has tech support (e.g., "Yes," "No," or "No internet service"). This column is of type "object."</br>

<b>14.StreamingTV:</b> An indicator of whether the customer has streaming TV (e.g., "Yes," "No," or "No internet service"). This column is of type "object."</br>

<b>15.StreamingMovies:</b> An indicator of whether the customer has streaming movies (e.g., "Yes," "No," or "No internet service"). This column is of type "object."</br>

<b>17.PaperlessBilling:</b> An indicator of whether the customer receives paperless billing (e.g., "Yes" or "No"). This column is of type "object."</br>

<b>18.PaymentMethod:</b> The payment method used by the customer (e.g., Electronic check, Mailed check, Bank transfer, Credit card). This column is of type "object."</br>

<b>19.MonthlyCharges:</b> The monthly charges incurred by the customer. This column is of type "float64."</br>

<b>20.TotalCharges:</b> The total charges incurred by the customer. This column is of type "object." It may need to be converted to a numerical type for analysis, as it likely represents a numeric value.</br>

<b>21.Churn:</b> The target variable indicating whether the customer has churned (e.g., "Yes" or "No"). This column is of type "object."
