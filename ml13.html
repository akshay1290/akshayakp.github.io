                                <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
								<p>
                                    The problem at hand is to predict whether a product ordered from an international e-commerce company will reach the customer on time or not. This is a binary classification problem where the goal is to build a model that can accurately classify products as either "reached on time" (0) or "did not reach on time" (1). Additionally, the project aims to analyze various factors that affect product delivery and study customer behavior.</br>
                                       <b> The project objectives outline the specific goals to be achieved, which might include::</b></br>
                                      <b> Delivery Prediction:</b> Develop a predictive model that can classify products as either "reached on time" or "did not reach on time" based on a set of input features.</br>
                                      <b>  Feature Analysis: </b>Explore the dataset to identify which variables are most relevant for predicting on-time delivery and to understand the factors affecting delivery times.</br>
                                        <b>  Customer Behavior Analysis:</b> Study customer behavior by analyzing variables like customer ratings, prior purchases, modes of shipment, and customer care calls to gain insights into how these factors impact delivery outcomes.</br>
                                            <b>  Data Preprocessing:</b> Prepare the dataset for modeling by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling or normalizing features as needed.</br>
                                                <b>  Model Selection and Training:</b> Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for classification, train the models, and optimize their hyperparameters.</br>
                                                    <b>  Evaluation: </b>Assess the model's performance using relevant classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.</br>
                                                        <b>  Insights and Recommendations:</b> Provide insights into factors that influence on-time delivery and offer recommendations to improve the delivery process based on the analysis.
                                           
                                    </p>
                                    <h2>About the dataset</h2>
								<p>
                                    <b>The dataset used for this project contains 10,999 observations of 12 variables. The dataset includes the following information:</b></br>

                                    ID: ID number of customers.</br>
                                    Warehouse_block: The company's big warehouse divided into blocks (A, B, C, D, E).</br>
                                    Mode_of_Shipment: The method of product shipment (e.g., Ship, Flight, Road).</br>
                                    Customer_care_calls: The number of calls made for shipment-related inquiries.</br>
                                    Customer_rating: Customer ratings, ranging from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest).</br>
                                    Cost_of_the_Product: Cost of the product in US dollars.</br>
                                    Prior_purchases: The number of prior purchases made by the customer.</br>
                                    Product_importance: Categorization of product importance (low, medium, high).</br>
                                    Gender: Gender of the customer (Male or Female).</br>
                                    Discount_offered: Discount offered on the product.</br>

These insights may include recommendations for optimizing the delivery process, improving customer satisfaction, and potentially reducing delivery delays.
